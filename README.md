# EHB-Autosplitter
Autosplitter for else Heart.Break(). Will reset if you close the game.

## How to use
Open Livesplit, right click and select "Edit splits...". Make sure else Heart.Break() is selected. You should see the button to activate this autosplitter below. For Press H%, you should go to the settings and disable "Split after boat cutscene", since pressing H will skip the cutscene and make it immediately split.
